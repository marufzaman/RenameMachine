# RenameMachine

It is a simple file renaming script built with Python3 and Works on Windows. 
It renames multiple .srt type files at once for the folder full of video files and matches the names of all of the video file names in the directory.
I wrote this to organize my TV Series collection.

If anyone has any suggestions, please point those out.
